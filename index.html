    <p>The koala is well known worldwide and is a major draw for Australian zoos and wildlife parks. It has been featured in advertisements, games, cartoons, and as soft toys.[130] It benefited the national tourism industry by over an estimated billion Australian dollars in 1998, a figure that has since grown.[131] In 1997, half of visitors to Australia, especially those from Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, sought out zoos and wildlife parks; about 75% of European and Japanese tourists placed the koala at the top of their list of animals to see.[132] According to biologist Stephen Jackson: "If you were to take a straw poll of the animal most closely associated with Australia, it's a fair bet that the koala would come out marginally in front of the kangaroo".[130] Factors that contribute to the koala's enduring popularity include its child-like body proportions and teddy bear-like face.</p>
